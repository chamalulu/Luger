     *  States      - Represent the state of an entity at a point in time.
     *                  Ex. CustomerState { Id, Name }
     *  Read Models - Represent any queryable state.
     *                  Ex. CustomersByName : Dict<string, CustomerId>

     * Functions:
     *  State transitions   - Evolves state with events. state -> event -> state
     *  Event handlers      - Subscribes to events. Perform business logic. event -> unit

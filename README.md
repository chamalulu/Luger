This repository contains a (very) disordered collection of personal pet
projects.

The small and, in my opinion, useful projects below will be cared for and if
not, they are, also in my opinion, easily maintainable.


A couple of them have actually made it out alive:

## [Luger.Functional.Maybe](Functional/Maybe/README.md)

[![Nuget](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Luger.Functional.Maybe?label=Luger.Functional.Maybe&logo=NuGet)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Luger.Functional.Maybe)

A composable C# flavored implementation of an option type for value types and
non-nullable reference types.

## [Luger.Functional.Async](Functional/Async/README.md)

[![Nuget](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Luger.Functional.Async?label=Luger.Functional.Async&logo=NuGet)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Luger.Functional.Async)

Extensions for `Task<T>` to provide LINQ query support.

Cheers!
